<!-- Programs -->
## Programs
The Programs withing this repository are primarily composed of C# but use several other resources depending on the project or goal. The specifics of some of the programs are detailed below but many are simple concept programs meant to demonstrate a specific tool or use. For instance the Polymorphism Assignment demonstrates Polymorphism and that's it. So some programs are not detailed below but are still good examples.
// make a master program that demonstrates all the concepts that some of the individual programs use. Such as the Polymorphism and Enums. just consolidate all of them into a main concepts file.
